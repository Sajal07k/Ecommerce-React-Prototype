# 🛍️ E-Commerce React Prototype

## 📖 Overview
This project is a React-based eCommerce prototype created to revise and strengthen core frontend concepts such as state management, routing, and API integration.
Although minimal in design, it focuses on implementing clean architecture, functional components, and best practices for scalable React development.

## 🚀 Features
* 🧭 React Router – Enables smooth navigation between product, cart, and detail pages.
* ⚙️ Redux Toolkit (RTK) – Handles global state management for cart items and product data efficiently.
* 🌐 Axios – Fetches product data from a fake store API for practical integration practice.
* 💾 Local Storage – Persists cart data even after page reloads.
* 🔁 Reusable Components – Designed to easily scale with additional features later.

## 🧩 Tech Stack
* React.js
* Redux Toolkit (RTK)
* React Router DOM
* Axios
* Local Storage

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was built primarily for concept revision and hands-on practice.
It focuses on understanding real-world patterns used in React projects such as:
* Managing API calls
* Handling global states with Redux Toolkit
* Routing between multiple views
* Persisting user data locally

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements
* Adding modern UI with Tailwind CSS or Material UI
